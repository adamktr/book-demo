# book-demo

As you can see, I didn't use any fancy new JS framework, mainly because during the past few years I've been working on the backend side, 
and I have no up-to-date experience in client-side JS frameworks.

´npm run start´

There are a lot of missing from the project which I'd add if it was a production software and/or I had more time:
 - tests
 - client-side framework:)
 - ui/ux
 - build/deploy tools
 - eslint
 - error handling

There are a lot of missing functionalities/bugs as well:
 - no progress bar during the search
 - items in the cart are not clickable
 - details page doesn't navigate to other url (browsing history is not working)
 - a lot other I didn't know about or I forgot to mention here:)
